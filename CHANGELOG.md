## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-08

### Changed
- Tunnel infrastructure now runs under launchd with `KeepAlive=true` — when the Cloudflare quick tunnel dies, launchd automatically restarts the script, which starts a fresh tunnel and pushes the new URL to Vercel via REST API (no redeploy required)
- Replaced Vercel CLI dependency with a direct `PATCH /v9/projects/{id}/env/{envId}` REST call using a token stored at `~/Library/Scripts/polaris/.vercel-token`
- `tunnel-update.sh` now blocks on the tunnel process (`wait $TUNNEL_PID`) so launchd receives the exit signal correctly

### Added
- `scripts/launchd/com.polaris.ollama.plist` — keeps `ollama serve` alive at login
- `scripts/launchd/com.polaris.tunnel.plist` — runs `tunnel-update.sh` at login, restarts on exit (ThrottleInterval=15s)
- `scripts/launchd/com.polaris.cloudflared.plist` — reference plist for named-tunnel mode
- Ollama readiness wait loop (30 × 2s) in `tunnel-update.sh` — handles Mac wake latency before the tunnel starts

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- `create_purchase_order` tool now validates `product_id` is a real UUID before the Postgres INSERT. Previously, the agent could hallucinate a non-UUID value (e.g. `"12345"`) causing `invalid input syntax for type uuid` errors. The tool now returns a soft error directing the agent to call `check_inventory` first and use the actual `product.id` field.
- Updated `product_id` tool description to explicitly state the value must come from `check_inventory` output — prevents hallucination at the prompt level.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Initial release: autonomous inventory agent with Hermes tool loop
- `check_inventory`, `flag_alerts`, `fetch_supplier_prices`, `write_memory`, `read_memory`, `check_website_prices`, `monitor_competitor_prices`, `create_purchase_order`, `log_decision` tools
- Draft purchase orders with 1-tap email approval link
- Decision audit trail via `decision_log` table
- Self-healing loop with jittered retry, checkpoint every 3 iterations, reflection
- Groq cloud fallback when Ollama is unavailable
- GitHub Actions cron — daily 6am AEST
